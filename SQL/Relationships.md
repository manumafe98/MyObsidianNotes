In relational databases, tables store data, but those tables often need to be connected to represent real-world relationships between the data they hold. These connections are established through relationships between tables.

## One to One

In a one-to-one relationship, a single record in one table can be associated with at most one record in another table, and vice versa. This is a less common relationship type, but it can be useful in specific scenarios.

## Many to One

In a many-to-one relationship, a single record in one table (the "one" side) can be associated with multiple records in another table (the "many" side). This is a very common relationship type used to model hierarchical structures.

## Many to Many

In a many-to-many relationship, a single record in one table can be associated with multiple records in another table, and vice versa. This type of relationship often requires a junction table to establish the connections between the two main tables.
