SQL stands for Structured Query Language. It's a standardized programming language specifically designed for managing data stored in relational databases. Relational databases organize data in tables with rows and columns, similar to a spreadsheet. SQL enables you to interact with these databases by:

- **Defining the structure**: tables, columns, data types using Data Definition Language also called [[DDL]] 
- **Manipulating data**: adding, updating, deleting using Data Manipulation Language also called [[DML]]
- **Retrieving data**:  filtering, sorting, summarizing using Data Query Language also called [[DQL]]
