Bitwise operations are operations that directly manipulate bits in a binary representation of data.
It uses bitwise operators instead of logical operators.

- Bitwise AND = ``&``
- Logical AND = ``&&``

Some implementations of bitwise operations.

-  odd-number AND 1 is 1
-  even-number AND 1 is 0
-  zero AND 1 is 0
