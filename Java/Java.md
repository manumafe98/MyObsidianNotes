Java is a widely-used, high-level, object-oriented programming language that was developed by Sun Microsystems (now owned by Oracle Corporation) in the mid-1990s.

### Object Oriented
Java is fundamentally object-oriented, which means it focuses on organizing code into reusable objects and classes.

### Compiled
Java code is compiled into bytecode, which is then executed by the [[JDK#JVM|JVM]]. This bytecode can run on various operating systems and hardware as long as there is a JVM available for that platform.

### Strong typed
This means that in Java, every variable and expression has a specific data type, and the type of a value is checked at compile-time.

Also supports multi threading and has a garbage collector.
