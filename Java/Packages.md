  
In [[Java]], a ``package`` is a way to organize and group related classes and interfaces together. It provides a hierarchical structure for organizing your Java code, making it easier to manage and maintain larger projects. Packages help prevent naming conflicts between classes in different parts of your project and also enable you to control the access level of classes and members within the package.
It might seem like you are creating a directory in the `src` folder when you define a package.

```java
package com.example.myapp;
```

```css
src/
└── com/
    └── example/
        └── myapp/
            └── YourJavaClass.java
```
