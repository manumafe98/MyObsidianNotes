The JDK is a software development kit for [[Java]] that provides all the tools, executables, and binaries required for developing, compiling, and running Java applications.

### JRE
The JRE is a runtime environment that allows Java applications to run on a target system.

### JVM
Is included in the JRE and is responsible for executing Java bytecode, as well as core libraries and essential files needed to run Java applications.
When you compile Java source code with the JDK, it is converted into platform-independent bytecode. The JVM then interprets or compiles this bytecode into native machine code for the host system at runtime.

### Manage multiple JDKS

To change between versions, you have to modify the:
- ``JAVA_HOME``
- ``Environment variables``
