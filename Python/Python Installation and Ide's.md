## Installation
For Windows go to [Python ORG](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and download it.

For Linux python3 comes installed so you can check what version do you have with:
```bash

If you want a more updated version you can use the update and upgrade commands that correspond to your Linux distro.

## IDE'S
An integrated development environment (IDE) is a software application that helps programmers develop software code efficiently.

For [[Python]] we can use:

- [Pycharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/) its an ide more centered in Python development so it has unique features like the bulb that pops when you import a package that needs to be installed also has tracking about the PEP8 rules so you make your code more pythonic.

- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) Its an ide that can be used for all programming languages and has multiple extensions that can helpful in you programming experience.

- [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/) Its like an Ide that has integrated [Jupyter nootebooks](https://jupyter.org/) that its mostly used as a data science tool because you can execute you code as small blocks of code, also as an alternative you can use in Google drive, Google Colaboratory

- [Jupyter Notebooks](https://jupyter.org/) if you want to use it without installing anaconda
```bash
 pip install notebook
 jupyter notebook
```
