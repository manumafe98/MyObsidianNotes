The **DOM** (Document Object Model) is an API that represents and interacts with any HTML or XML based markup language document. 

The DOM is a document model loaded in the browser and representing the document as a node tree, or **DOM tree**, where each node represents part of the document.

The DOM is one of the most-used API's on the Web because it allows code running in a browser to access and interact with every node in the document. Nodes can be created, moved, and changed. [[Event Listeners]] can be added to nodes and triggered on the occurrence of a given event.

See [[Javascript/Browser API/DOM/Selectors|selectors]] to know how to interact with nodes.
