Python is a popular high-level programming language known for its simplicity, readability, and versatility. It was first released in 1991 by Guido van Rossum and has since become one of the most widely used programming languages in the world.

### Interpreted language
Python does not need to be compiled before being executed.

### Object oriented
Python is designed to organize data and functions into reusable, modular units called objects. Objects are instances of classes, which are essentially blueprints or templates for creating objects. Classes define the attributes and methods that objects can have.

### Dynamically typed
This allows variables to be assigned values of any type at runtime, without requiring the programmer to declare the variable's data type in advance. This means that the type of a variable is determined dynamically at runtime based on the value it holds at that moment. This means that a variable that is holding an integer later in the code can be changed to hold a string.

### Module vs Framework

#### module
A Python <u>module</u> is a single file or collection of files that contains reusable code that can be imported and used in other Python programs. Examples: requests, pandas, os, etc.

#### Framework
A Python <u>framework</u> is a collection of modules and libraries that are designed to provide a complete solution for a specific type of application. A framework usually includes a set of rules, guidelines, and best practices for developing applications in a particular domain.
Examples: [[Flask]], Django, FastApi, etc

Both cases are installed via [[Pip]]
